# Detecting-Stroke-in-Human-Beings-using-Machine-Learning

In developing and underdeveloped nations, stroke is a leading cause of mortality and
disability. Stroke is a life-threatening condition that develops when there is a lack of
blood flow to the brain from the carotid arteries and vertebral arteries. Because the
brain suffers damage and can quickly expire without oxygen, stroke frequently
results in death and can occasionally affect nearby body parts if the patient is not
given prompt medical attention. Spasticity, contractures, paralysis, and death are
among the effects. According to the World Health Organization, stroke accounts for
over 137,000 fatalities per year in the United States alone and over 451,000 deaths
per year in Africa. Today, stroke is a medical illness that affects people in practically
every region of the world, including industrialized, developing, and undeveloped
nations. In general, 1 in 4 adults over 25 will experience a stroke at some point in
their lives. This year, 12.2 million people are predicted to experience their first stroke,
and 6.5 million of them will pass away as a result. The number of stroke victims
worldwide exceeds 110 million. What if this global endemic could be stopped? The
world will be safer and life expectancy will rise if accurate stroke prediction
technology is developed. We have proposed our research study to develop a
solution to predict strokes in people using machine learning. We have employed four
models/classifiers to check the accuracy on each of them with same dataset of
people and we have achieved great results. The two models gave 98% and 98.29%
successful accuracy results which is very close to state-of-the-art methods (99%).
